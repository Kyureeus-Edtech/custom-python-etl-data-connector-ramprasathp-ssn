# Custom ETL Data Connector: CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)

This project contains a Python ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) script to fetch data from the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog and load it into a MongoDB database.

The script enriches the raw data by converting date strings to datetime objects, calculating a remediation timeframe, and adding audit fields. This was created as part of the Software Architecture assignment for SSN College of Engineering.
